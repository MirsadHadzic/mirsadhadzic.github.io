Personal Portfolio


With the utilization of Massively by HTML5 UP and its accompanying templates, in conjunction with the utilization 
of various web development technologies including HTML, SCSS, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully created this portfolio. 
The process required a significant amount of modifications, however, the final outcome is exceptional. 
The primary focus of the portfolio includes showcasing my past projects as well as providing my contact information.
